# Laravel Static Routes

This laravel package will create an apache 2 .htaccess file in the public directory with all the laravel routes.

***Remember this package is under development, check that everything is still working***

Once installed you only need to run the following command:

    php artisan laravel-static-routes:apache-2

Remember to create a 404.html file in the public directory or an apache 2 error will appear instead.
